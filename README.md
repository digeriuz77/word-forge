This 12-week programme is designed to accelerate vocabulary development by prioritizing the acquisition of high-impact, cross-disciplinary academic words (Tier 2/Mortar Words) and dedicating a systematic phase to understanding **base words** through **morphological analysis** (roots and affixes).

Vocabulary instruction must be robust and systematic, requiring **7 to 10 exposures** for retention, and activities should incorporate deep processing techniques like the Frayer Model.

## The 12-Week Vocabulary Acceleration Programme

The programme is structured based on the comprehensive accelerated language intervention phases found in the sources.

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1–8): Foundational Academic Vocabulary and Functions

This phase focuses on core academic language functions and consistently targets high-utility Tier 2 words that are critical for understanding concepts across subject areas.

| Weekly Block | Primary Focus Area | Key Tier 2 Words (Base Vocabulary) | Core Strategy/Activities | Base Word/Morphology Introduction |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Weeks 1–2** | **Identify, Describe, Report, Seek Information** | **Identify, Rule, Instruction, Test, Measure, Determine, Estimate, Analysis, Interpret, Size, Scale**. | **Robust Instruction:** Model slow and quick pronunciation, provide student-friendly definitions, and use the **Frayer Model** (including L1 support for deep processing). Use **Vocabulary Games** (e.g., Word Bingo/Quizlet Live) for review. | Introduce affixes that change word form, such as **'-tion'** (e.g., *measure* $\to$ *measurement*). |
| **Weeks 3–4** | **Compare/Contrast & Sequence**. | **Classify, Category, Pattern, Compare, Differ, Similar, Examine, Model, Process, Sequence, Structure**. | **Word Sorts/Classification Practice:** Students group vocabulary by shared characteristics (e.g., concepts or function). Teach **Sequencing Words** (e.g., *First, next, before, after, finally*). | Explicitly teach **prefix 'in-'** (meaning 'not' or 'opposite') to help unlock academic terms (e.g., relating to *Invertebrates*). |
| **Weeks 5–6** | **Structure, Function, Cause/Effect**. | **Function, System, Organize, Apply, Effect, Factor, Determine, Explain, Consequently, Pressure**. | **Syntax Focus:** Teach challenging grammatical structures like the **Passive Voice** (common in scientific explanations). Use **Sentence Stems** for practicing classification (e.g., *We can classify ___ according to...*). | Introduce foundational **Greek/Latin roots** commonly found in science (e.g., *micro-, bio-*) using **Root Word Cards**. |
| **Weeks 7–8** | **Analysis & Interpretation (Diagrams/Text)**. | **Analyze, Develop, Improve, Illustrate, Contribute, Sustain, Interaction, Feature, Demonstrate, Express**. | **Unpacking Juicy Sentences:** Break down long, complex academic sentences into manageable chunks. Review **Polysemous Words** (multiple meanings, e.g., *Force*, *Factor*). | Focus on **Word Families:** Show how prefixes/suffixes change word form (e.g., verb *identify* to noun *identification*). |

### Phase 2 (Weeks 9–12): Systematic Morphology and Advanced Application

This phase systematically focuses on morphological instruction, treating prefixes, suffixes, and roots as essential **base words** for decoding complex vocabulary.

| Weekly Block | Primary Focus Area | Key Base Words/Morphology Focus | Key Tier 2 Words (Reinforcement/Extension) | Core Strategy/Activities |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Week 9** | **Prefixes (Negation/Reversal)** | **Affix Instruction (Prefixes):** Focus on high-frequency prefixes like **un-** and **dis-** (meaning 'not' or 'opposite'). | *Un*like, *Dis*agree, *Un*recognisable, *Dis*connect. | Implement "Morphine Mondays". Use Root Word Cards to brainstorm related words. |
| **Week 10** | **Prefixes (In/Re/Mis)** | Focus on **in-/im-** (meaning 'not' or 'in/into') and **re-** (meaning 'again' or 'back'). | *In*competent, *Im*possible, *Re*build, *Re*vise, *Re*cover, *Mis*trust, *Over*react. | **Morphological Analysis:** Analyze word structure (affix-root-affix). Teach cognates where applicable (e.g., *planet/planeta*). |
| **Week 11** | **Suffixes (Derivational)** | **Affix Instruction (Suffixes):** Focus on suffixes that change the part of speech (derivational suffixes), such as **-ion, -able, -al, -y, -ness**. | Perception $\to$ Percuption, persuade $\to$ persuasive. Develop $\to$ Development, Organize $\to$ Organization. | **Word Forms:** Practice transforming words (e.g., verb *act* to noun *action* to adjective *active* to adverb *actively*). Use **Look, Say, Cover, Write, Check** for spelling retention. |
| **Week 12** | **Root Word Mastery and Review** | Systematic study of common **Greek/Latin Roots**: Focus on roots that generate word families (e.g., **form** (to shape) $\to$ inform, reform, deform, information; **port** (to carry) $\to$ deported, report, import). | Review critical Tier 2 verbs: **Analyze, Determine, Explain, Solve, Verify, Interpret, Justify**. | **Word Association Games:** Match target vocabulary to related words or phrases. Require students to construct sentences demonstrating word meaning. |

### Key Base Words for Development

The sources emphasize that teaching **morphology** (the study of word parts) is a **powerful strategy** for unlocking academic vocabulary and should be an integral part of instruction, particularly in Step 4 of Marzano's six-step process.

The essential base elements to prioritize include:

| Type of Base Word | Examples and Focus | Purpose for Vocabulary Development |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 2 Action Verbs (Core Base)** | **Analyze, compare, determine, explain, identify, relate, illustrate, interpret, justify, examine**. | These verbs are fundamental to understanding academic and assessment tasks across disciplines (e.g., Maths problem-solving directions). They often form the base for many complex Tier 2 nouns via derivational suffixes (e.g., *analyze* $\to$ *analysis*). |
| **High-Frequency Prefixes** | **un-**, **re-**, **in-**, **im-**, **dis-**, **non-**, **over-**, **mis-**. | These affixes are used in 97–99 per cent of all prefixed words. Teaching them allows students to instantly unlock the meaning of complex vocabulary (e.g., *unrecognisable*). |
| **High-Frequency Suffixes** | **-s, -es, -ed, -ing, -ly, -er, -ion, -able, -al, -y, -ness**. | These suffixes primarily affect the root word’s part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). Understanding them helps students use words in the correct grammatical form required for academic discourse. |
| **General Greek/Latin Roots (Content Linked)** | Roots such as **bio-, hydro-, photo-, micro-, vert-, geo-, graph-, therm-**. | Many technical (Tier 3) and academic (Tier 2) terms, particularly in Science, are derived from these roots. Focusing on them strengthens the ability to infer meaning in new words. |

### Instructional Note on Robust Learning

Vocabulary learning is essential for academic success and reading comprehension. Effective instruction should be systematic, explicit, and incorporate **deep processing**. Deep processing means students are actively engaged in discussing and processing the word, such as creating non-linguistic representations (drawing symbols or pictures).

Think of vocabulary acquisition as building a house: the basic Tier 1 words are the common bricks, while **Tier 3 (subject-specific) words are specialised bricks** needed for the walls. The **Tier 2 words** (like *analyze, compare, process*) and the **morphological structures (roots/affixes)** are the **mortar** that holds everything together, enabling the whole structure of academic discourse to stand. By focusing on Tier 2 words and the mortar of morphology, you create a sturdy framework capable of supporting specialized knowledge.
